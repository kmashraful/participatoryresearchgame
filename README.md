# Participatory Research Game

Role Selection: Students choose from 4 disciplines (Natural Resource, Geography, Forestry, Engineering), each with unique perspectives that shape how they view scenarios.
5-Domain Journey: The game progresses through all five domains of the Duea et al. framework with realistic scenarios at each stage:

Domain 1: Building trust with skeptical community members
Domain 2: Balancing competing priorities and visions
Domain 3: Choosing data collection methods
Domain 4: Deciding how to mobilize for impact
Domain 5: Evaluating success meaningfully

Consequential Choices: Each decision affects 4 stats (Trust, Impact, Resources, Alignment) that track throughout, showing how choices cascade through the research process.
Role-Based Perspectives: Every scenario includes discipline-specific viewpoints, helping students understand how their training influences their approach.
Rich Discussion Prompts: At the end, students get personalized insights based on their journey plus discussion questions to facilitate class conversation.
The game takes about 10-15 minutes to play through, making it perfect for in-class activities followed by group discussion about what everyone experienced and learned!
