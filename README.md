# Participatory Research Game

Role Selection: Students choose from 4 disciplines (Natural Resource, Geography, Forestry, Engineering), each with unique perspectives that shape how they view scenarios.

5-Domain Journey: The game progresses through all five domains of the Duea et al. framework (Duea, S. R., Zimmerman, E. B., Vaughn, L. M., Dias, S., & Harris, J. (2022). A Guide to Selecting Participatory Research Methods Based on Project and Partnership Goals. Journal of Participatory Research Methods, 3(1). https://doi.org/10.35844/001c.32605) with realistic scenarios at each stage:

Domain 1: Building trust with skeptical community members
Domain 2: Balancing competing priorities and visions
Domain 3: Choosing data collection methods
Domain 4: Deciding how to mobilize for impact
Domain 5: Evaluating success meaningfully

Consequential choices: Each decision affects 4 stats (Trust, Impact, Resources, Alignment) that track throughout, showing how choices cascade through the research process.

Role-Based perspectives: Every scenario includes discipline-specific viewpoints, helping students understand how their training influences their approach.

At the end, students get personalized insights based on their journey plus discussion questions to facilitate class conversation.
